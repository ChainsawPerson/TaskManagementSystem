# Task Management System

## Design and Logic:

### Tasks:

- [x] Create new tasks with 6 basic fields
- [x] New Task marked as "Open" status
- [x] Edit all fields of a task
- [x] Delete a task and its reminders

### Categories:

- [x] Create new categories with custom name
- [x] Edit category name
- [x] Delete a category and automatically delete all tasks in the category

### Priority

- [x] Default priority
- [x] Create new priority levels woth custom name
- [x] Edit priority name (except Default)
- [x] Delete priority levels (except Default)
- [x] Deletion of priority level moves tasks to Default level

### Reminders (NEEDS TESTING)

- [x] Create task reminders
- [x] 1 task per reminder, multiple reminders per task
- [x] If task is completed, cannot create reminder
- [x] If task is changed to completed, automatically delete all affiliated reminders
- [x] Reminder types:
    * 1 day before deadline
    * 1 week -||-
    * 1 month -||-
    * Predetermined date
- [x] Notify user with message
- [x] Edit reminder
- [x] Delete reminder
